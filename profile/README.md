At Banda Health, we seek to transform healthcare where people need it most. We enable people to get good healthcare through the software we provide. Good healthcare, in our eyes, is getting the right diagnosis, at the right time, right away. We empower health teams to transform healthcare in the most resource-challenged communities of the world, creating technology today to do what was impossible yesterday.

Currently, patients in sub-Saharan Africa have 1% of the money (compared to the world's total) while having 25% of the disease. And when resources are limited,
- **Patients get the wrong diagnosis** because clinics don't have doctors to help diagnose and provide treatment decisions
- **The wrong treatment is prescribed** because clinics don't have the right treatment and substitute the wrong thing, or
- **The healthcare comes at the wrong time** because quality healthcare is too far away, especially if travelling on foot

We're currently operating in 60+ clinics across sub-Saharan Africa with a goal to expand to 10,000 and serve over 50 million patients a years. We seek to meet the above needs by giving
- **The right diagnosis** with use of AI to help team make doctor-level diagnoses when there is no doctor
- **And the right treatment** by leveraging business tools to help clinics run at peak performance and help keep the right medicines stocked 24/7
- **Right away** with integrated solutions to help teams improve healthcare a close to the patient as possible

This wasn't possible 15 years ago. Now, the internet is almost everywhere, even in the world's most resource-challenged areas. We're pushing forward to facilitate this happening.
